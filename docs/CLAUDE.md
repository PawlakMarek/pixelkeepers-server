# PixelKeepers Service Framework (PSF) - Implementation Guide

This document provides instructions for Claude instances working on the PSF (PixelKeepers Service Framework) implementation.

## Overview

We are replacing SHB (Self-Hosted Blocks) with a custom-built framework called PSF. The framework uses a contract-based architecture for better reliability, debuggability, and maintainability.

## Essential Documents

### Primary Technical Specification
- **PSF_IMPLEMENTATION.md** - Complete technical specification with all implementation details
  - Contains exact file structures, data formats, function signatures
  - Includes contract definitions, provider implementations, and service examples
  - Memory-independent and complete enough for implementation from scratch

### Live Documentation (Updated During Implementation)
- **CLAUDE.md** - This file, provides workflow instructions
- **PSF_IMPLEMENTATION.md** - Technical specification (update as design evolves)

## Working Principles

### 1. Documentation-First Development
- **ALWAYS** read PSF_IMPLEMENTATION.md before starting any work
- **ALWAYS** update documentation when making design changes
- Keep documentation in sync with code implementation
- Document design decisions and rationale

### 2. Contract-Driven Architecture
- Services declare **what they need** (SSL, backup, secrets, LDAP, SSO)
- Providers deliver **how to fulfill** those needs
- Contracts define the **interface** between services and providers
- Follow the exact contract patterns defined in PSF_IMPLEMENTATION.md

### 3. Build-Time Validation
- Everything must be validated during `nix flake check`
- No runtime surprises or deployment failures
- Fail fast with clear error messages and actionable hints

## Current Project State

### Implementation Status âœ… UPDATED
PSF framework implementation progress:
- âœ… **Phase 1: Core Framework** - Complete PSF library with contract resolution and validation
- ðŸ”„ **Phase 2: Essential Contracts** - Database contract implemented; SSL, backup, secrets, LDAP, SSO, proxy contracts need implementation
- ðŸ”„ **Phase 3: Core Providers** - Database providers (PostgreSQL 17, MySQL) implemented; other providers need implementation
- ðŸ”„ **Phase 4: Core Services** - Basic test service created; production services need implementation

### Recent Achievements
- **Database Contract**: Complete with PostgreSQL 17 as default, extension support, validation
- **Development Environment**: Unified at project root with httpie, jq, yq for debugging
- **Flake Validation**: Working end-to-end including secrets structure validation via template system
- **Git Integration**: Proper branch structure and commit signing working

## Git Workflow

### Repository Organization

This is a **monorepo** containing two interconnected projects:
- **PSF** (`psf/`) - Framework development
- **nixos-core** (`nixos-core/`) - Production server configuration

**GitHub Repository:** https://github.com/PawlakMarek/pixelkeepers-server (private)
**SSH Clone:** `git clone git@github.com:PawlakMarek/pixelkeepers-server.git`

**Repository Configuration:**
- SSH commit signing enabled and required
- Protected main branch (production-ready code only)
- All commits must be signed with SSH key

### Branch Strategy

```
main                    # Stable, production-ready
â”œâ”€â”€ develop            # Active development integration
â”œâ”€â”€ psf/core          # PSF core framework development
â”œâ”€â”€ psf/contracts     # PSF contract system development  
â”œâ”€â”€ psf/providers     # PSF provider development
â”œâ”€â”€ nixos-core/config # Production server configuration
â””â”€â”€ nixos-core/migration # SHB to PSF migration work
```

### Starting New Work

#### For PSF Framework Development
```bash
# Create feature branch from develop
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b psf/feature-name

# Work in psf/ directory
cd psf
# ... make changes ...

# Commit and push (commits are automatically signed)
git add psf/
git commit -m "psf: implement feature description

ðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
git push origin psf/feature-name
```

```bash
# Create feature branch from main (since this affects production)
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b nixos-core/feature-name

# Work in nixos-core/ directory
cd nixos-core
# ... make changes ...

# Test before committing
nix flake check

# Commit and push (commits are automatically signed)

### Security Considerations

**Always verify .gitignore rules before committing:**
```bash
# Check what will be committed
git status
git diff --cached

# Verify no secrets are staged
git diff --cached --name-only | grep -E "(secrets|\.key|\.pem)"
```

**Protected files (automatically gitignored):**
- `nixos-core/ssh` - SSH private key
- `nixos-core/secrets.yaml` - SOPS secrets
- Any `*.key`, `*.pem` files

**Tracked files:**
- `nixos-core/ssh.pub` - SSH public key
- Configuration files without secrets

### Commit Signing Requirements

**All commits MUST be signed with SSH key:**
```bash
# Repository is configured for SSH signing
git config commit.gpgsign true
git config gpg.format ssh
git config user.signingkey ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

# Commits are automatically signed
git commit -m "message"

# To re-sign an existing commit
git commit --amend --no-edit -S
```

**Verify commit signatures:**
```bash
# Check if commits are signed
git log --show-signature --oneline -5

# Verify specific commit
git verify-commit <commit-hash>
```

### Integration Workflow

#### Merging PSF Changes
```bash
# PSF changes go through develop branch
git checkout develop
git merge psf/feature-name
git push origin develop

# When ready for production integration
git checkout main
git merge develop
git push origin main
```

#### Merging nixos-core Changes
```bash
# nixos-core changes go directly to main (production)
git checkout main
git merge nixos-core/feature-name
git push origin main
```

## Server Management

### SSH Access (from project root)
```bash
# Regular SSH access (after boot)
nix run .#nixos-core-ssh          # Local network (192.168.68.20:22)
nix run .#nixos-core-ssh-remote   # Remote access (pixelkeepers.net:3322)

# Boot/InitRD SSH access (for unlocking during boot)
nix run .#nixos-core-ssh-boot     # Local boot SSH (192.168.68.20:2222)
nix run .#nixos-core-ssh-boot-remote # Remote boot SSH (pixelkeepers.net:4422)

# Automated root pool unlock during boot
nix run .#nixos-core-unlock       # Tries local 2222, then remote 4422
```

### Deployment (from project root)
```bash
# Smart deployment (automatically chooses local or remote)
nix run .#deploy                  # Recommended - tries local, then remote

# Manual deployment options
nix run .#deploy-rs              # Local deployment only (192.168.68.20)
nix run .#deploy-rs-remote       # Remote deployment only (pixelkeepers.net:3322)

# Test configuration before deploying
cd nixos-core && nix flake check
```

### Network Access Patterns
**Local Network (when at home):**
- SSH: 192.168.68.20:22 (regular), 192.168.68.20:2222 (boot)
- Deploy: Direct to local IP

**Remote Access (when away from home):**
- SSH: pixelkeepers.net:3322 (regular), pixelkeepers.net:4422 (boot)
- Deploy: Via router port forwarding
- Router forwards 3322â†’192.168.68.20:22, 4422â†’192.168.68.20:2222

## Development Workflow

### Development Environment âœ… UPDATED

**Use the unified development environment from project root:**
```bash
# From project root directory
nix develop                       # Enter unified development environment
claude                           # Start Claude Code with all tools available
```

**Available tools and capabilities:**
- **Nix tools** - nixpkgs-fmt, statix, nixfmt-classic for code quality
- **Git tools** - gh, openssh with SSH signing pre-configured
- **Server tools** - deploy-rs, sops for server management
- **Documentation** - mdbook for generating docs
- **Development debugging** - httpie, curl, jq, yq, netcat for troubleshooting
- **Environment variables**:
  - `PSF_ROOT` - Path to PSF framework directory (`./psf`)
  - `NIXOS_CORE_ROOT` - Path to server configuration (`./nixos-core`)
  - `DOCS_PATH` - Path to documentation directory (`./docs`)
  - `PROJECT_ROOT` - Path to project root (`.`)

**Benefits:**
- Single development environment for both PSF and nixos-core work
- All project components accessible
- Consistent tooling across the entire project
- SSH signing and deployment tools pre-configured

### Starting New Work âœ… UPDATED
1. **Enter unified development environment** (`nix develop` from project root)
2. **Start Claude Code** (`claude`)
3. **Choose appropriate git branch** based on PSF vs nixos-core work
4. **Read docs/PSF_IMPLEMENTATION.md** completely to understand the current design
5. **Check existing code** in psf/ directory to understand implementation status
6. **Identify the specific task** from the implementation checklist
7. **Understand dependencies** - what needs to be implemented first

### Making Changes
1. **Follow exact patterns** defined in PSF_IMPLEMENTATION.md
2. **Use provided code examples** as templates
3. **Maintain consistency** with existing contract/provider interfaces
4. **Add proper error handling** with clear error messages

### Testing and Validation
1. **Build test** with `nix flake check` after every change
2. **Fix all warnings and errors** before proceeding
3. **Test contracts** work with multiple providers when possible
4. **Validate error messages** are helpful and actionable

### Documentation Updates
**ALWAYS update these documents when making changes:**

#### PSF_IMPLEMENTATION.md Updates
- Add new contracts to the contracts section
- Add new providers to the providers section
- Update code examples when interfaces change
- Update implementation checklist when completing tasks
- Add new error codes and messages to error handling section

#### CLAUDE.md Updates
- Update "Current Project State" when major milestones are reached
- Add new workflow instructions when processes change
- Update file structure when directories are added/changed
- Document new development patterns or conventions

## Implementation Guidelines

### Contract Implementation
- Use exact contract interface pattern from PSF_IMPLEMENTATION.md
- Include comprehensive validation functions
- Provide clear examples in contract documentation
- Follow naming conventions: contracts/<name>.nix

### Provider Implementation
- Use registerProvider helper function
- Implement all required interface functions (canFulfill, fulfill, validate)
- Include capability declarations
- Follow naming conventions: providers/<contract>/<provider>.nix

### Service Implementation
- Use psf.defineService pattern
- Declare all needs using contract requests
- Provide what the service offers to other services
- Include comprehensive health checks
- Follow naming conventions: services/<service>.nix

### Error Handling
- Use standardized error format from PSF_IMPLEMENTATION.md
- Provide specific error codes (PSF001, PSF002, etc.)
- Include actionable hints for fixing errors
- Test error conditions and messages

## Code Quality Standards

### File Organization
- Follow exact directory structure from PSF_IMPLEMENTATION.md
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Group related functionality logically
- Keep files focused and single-purpose

### Code Style
- Follow NixOS conventions and patterns
- Use clear, descriptive variable names
- Add comments only when business logic is complex
- Prefer explicit over implicit configurations

### Validation and Testing
- All code must pass `nix flake check`
- Include build-time validation for all contracts
- Test with multiple providers when available
- Validate error conditions and recovery

## Common Tasks

### Adding a New Contract
1. Create contracts/<name>.nix following the contract pattern
2. Add to contracts/default.nix exports
3. Add to lib/contracts.nix imports
4. Update PSF_IMPLEMENTATION.md with contract specification
5. Test with `nix flake check`

### Adding a New Provider
1. Create providers/<contract>/<provider>.nix following provider pattern
2. Add to providers/default.nix exports
3. Add to lib/providers.nix imports
4. Update PSF_IMPLEMENTATION.md with provider documentation
5. Test fulfillment with multiple contract requests

### Adding a New Service
1. Create services/<service>.nix following service pattern
2. Add to services/default.nix exports
3. Update PSF_IMPLEMENTATION.md with service example
4. Test service builds and validates correctly
5. Test service works with different provider combinations

### Migrating from SHB
1. Identify SHB service configuration in nixos-core/
2. Extract service requirements (SSL, backup, secrets, etc.)
3. Convert to PSF contract requests
4. Create PSF service definition
5. Test PSF service provides same functionality
6. Remove SHB service configuration
7. Update documentation

## Debugging and Troubleshooting

### Build Failures
1. Check `nix flake check` output for specific errors
2. Verify all imports and exports are correct
3. Check contract interface compliance
4. Validate provider canFulfill logic

### Contract Resolution Issues
1. Verify contract request format matches contract schema
2. Check provider canFulfill returns true for request
3. Validate provider configuration is complete
4. Check provider priority order in configuration

### Service Integration Issues
1. Verify service needs are properly declared
2. Check contract results are used correctly in service config
3. Validate health checks are appropriate
4. Test service isolation and dependencies

## Migration Timeline

We are migrating from SHB to PSF gradually:
1. **Current**: SHB-based services are running in production
2. **Implementation**: Building PSF framework alongside SHB
3. **Testing**: PSF services tested in parallel with SHB
4. **Migration**: One service at a time migration to PSF
5. **Completion**: SHB removal and cleanup

**Never break existing services during PSF development.**

## Communication Protocols

### When Stuck
- Re-read relevant sections of PSF_IMPLEMENTATION.md
- Check existing working examples in the specification
- Look for similar patterns in implemented code
- Ask for clarification on specific technical details

### When Making Design Changes
- Update PSF_IMPLEMENTATION.md with the new design
- Explain rationale for the change
